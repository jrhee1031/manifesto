<p>The techniques of commercial design promote given content to be presented or designed. Layers of meaning as well as associations within content is visually presented through the designer’s hands. However, this sort of design actually just relies upon the nature of the content, the underlying meaning. The designer, in essence, captures these moments and presents them as visual form; hence, the designer as a curator. <br><br>

Taking a step away from the designer’s urge to stylize or aestheticize, a pureness of the content and the natural links provides enough design to present meaning. perhaps anything deeper than control comes from chance.

An understanding of found collage or found collection as a form of design. design less curated but formed naturally.
